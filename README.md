I want to run all the servers as containers, adjust everything to work with Docker containers for all services.

1. Create a Docker Compose setup that includes Keycloak, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Nginx. Each service should be a container, and they need to communicate with each other.

- PostgreSQL: The Node.js app needs to connect to it.
    * Docker: create a postgres service with a volume for data persistence.
    * Environment variables for the database name, user, and password are necessary: set these via environment variables or a .env file.

- Keycloak: Keycloak needs to connect to the PostgreSQL database instead of the default H2.
    * Set environment variables for the database connection.
    * Keycloak must be initialized with the realm and client setup: Use a volume for importing the realm configuration. Alternatively, use environment variables for initial setup or a startup script. For simplicity, first configure Keycloak manually after initial startup, later automate realm creation.

- Node.js: Create a Dockerfile that installs dependencies, copies the source code, and starts the server.
    * The app needs to connect to PostgreSQL and Keycloak.
    * Docker Compose network: the services can communicate using the service names as hostnames. So, the PostgreSQL host would be the service name, like 'postgres', and Keycloak's URL would be 'http://keycloak:8080'. The app's environment variables should reflect these.

- Nginx: The Nginx container needs to serve the frontend files and reverse proxy to the Node.js app and Keycloak.
    * The frontend files can be built into the Nginx container or mounted via a volume.
    * The configuration file should proxy requests to /api to the Node.js service and /auth to Keycloak.
    * In Docker Compose, the Nginx service depends on the other services and uses the internal network to communicate.
    * The Nginx config needs to proxy requests to /auth to the Keycloak container. That way, the frontend can make requests to /auth and Nginx will route them to Keycloak.
    * The Keycloak URL should be set to '/auth' relative path, or the full URL pointing to the Nginx server's /auth path. For example, in the Keycloak init, the URL would be http://localhost/auth, since the frontend is served via Nginx on port 80. Then Nginx proxies /auth to the Keycloak container.

- Networking: All services should be on the same Docker network so they can communicate using service names. The ports need to be exposed appropriately. For example, Nginx might expose port 80, Keycloak 8080, but in the Docker network, they can use their internal ports.

- Volumes: For PostgreSQL data persistence, a volume is essential. Keycloak might also need a volume if we want to persist realm configurations, but for development, maybe it's okay to set up each time.

- Environment Variables: The Node.js app needs DB credentials, Keycloak settings, etc. These can be set in the Docker Compose file or via an .env file.

- Frontend: The HTML/JS files need to be served by Nginx.
    * The frontend code should be built into the Nginx container or mounted. Since the frontend uses Keycloak JS, the configuration there should point to the Keycloak service (e.g., http://localhost:8080 might not work if the frontend is served from the browser, so the Nginx config might need to proxy Keycloak's auth endpoints to avoid CORS issues).


So the Keycloak client configuration in the frontend should have the authServerUrl as 'http://localhost/auth' but that might not be correct. Alternatively, the frontend should access Keycloak through the same domain, so the Keycloak client's root URL and redirect URIs should be adjusted to use the Nginx proxy.

This is a bit tricky. Let me think: When the user accesses the app via http://localhost, Nginx serves the frontend. The frontend JS tries to authenticate via Keycloak, which is at http://localhost:8080 in the previous setup. But in the container setup, the frontend can't access Keycloak directly on port 8080 because it's running inside Docker. So the solution is to have Nginx proxy requests to Keycloak under a path like /auth. Then, in the frontend, the Keycloak client is initialized with the URL http://localhost/auth, and the Keycloak server's endpoints are accessible via that path.

But Keycloak might require certain paths, so the Nginx configuration needs to correctly proxy all necessary paths. For example, the Keycloak endpoints are under /auth/realms/..., so Nginx should proxy_pass /auth to the Keycloak container's /auth path.

Wait, the Keycloak container is running on port 8080, and the context path is /auth by default. So when Nginx proxies /auth to http://keycloak:8080/auth, that should work. Then, in the frontend, the Keycloak client is configured with the URL http://localhost/auth. That way, all Keycloak requests from the frontend go through Nginx to the Keycloak container.

So in the Keycloak client setup (in the Keycloak admin console), the Valid Redirect URIs would be http://localhost/*, since the frontend is served via Nginx on port 80.

This setup avoids CORS issues because all requests are going through the same origin (localhost:80) and Nginx is handling the proxying.

So adjusting the frontend code's Keycloak configuration to use the Nginx proxy path is necessary.

In the previous frontend code, the Keycloak init was:

Keycloak({

url: 'http://localhost:8080',

realm: 'car-booking',

clientId: 'seat-booking-app'

});

But in the container setup, this should be:

Keycloak({

url: 'http://localhost/auth',

realm: 'car-booking',

clientId: 'seat-booking-app'

});

Because Nginx is proxying /auth to the Keycloak container's /auth path on port 8080.

So the frontend's Keycloak client config needs to point to the Nginx proxy URL, not the Keycloak container directly.

That's an important change. The user needs to adjust the frontend code accordingly.

Now, putting this all into Docker Compose.

The docker-compose.yml would include services for postgres, keycloak, nodejs (backend), nginx, and possibly a frontend service if the frontend is built into a container.

Alternatively, the frontend static files can be served by Nginx directly, which might be simpler. So the Nginx service would have a volume pointing to the frontend files, or build the frontend into the Nginx image.

But for simplicity, maybe the frontend files are part of the Nginx container. So create a Dockerfile for Nginx that copies the frontend files into the HTML directory.

Wait, but in the previous answer, the frontend was a simple HTML file with inline JS. So perhaps the user has a directory with index.html and possibly other assets. In that case, the Nginx Dockerfile can copy these files into the container's /usr/share/nginx/html directory.

So, the structure would be:

project/

├── docker-compose.yml

├── backend/

│   ├── Dockerfile

│   ├── package.json

│   └── server.js

├── frontend/

│   └── public/

│       └── index.html

├── nginx/

│   ├── Dockerfile

│   └── nginx.conf

└── .env

The backend Dockerfile would build the Node.js app. The Nginx Dockerfile would copy the frontend files and the nginx.conf.

But maybe for simplicity, use a volume to mount the frontend files into the Nginx container during development. Alternatively, build them into the image.

In the docker-compose.yml:

services:

postgres:

image: postgres:latest

environment:

POSTGRES_DB: car

## Keycloak

Keycloak is a separate server that you manage on your network. Applications are configured to point to and be secured by this server.
Browser applications redirect a user’s browser from the application to the Keycloak authentication server where they enter their credentials. This redirection is important because users are completely isolated from applications and applications never see a user’s credentials. Applications instead are given an identity token or assertion that is cryptographically signed. These tokens can have identity information like username, address, email, and other profile data. They can also hold permission data so that applications can make authorization decisions.

```bash
export KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=<username>
export KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>

bin/kc.[sh|bat] start
```
